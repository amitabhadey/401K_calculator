This project involves developing a 401(k) contribution calculator web application using Python and Streamlit. The app will leverage numpy_financial for financial calculations and matplotlib for generating visual graphs based on user input. The primary goal is to help users project their 401(k) savings over time based on their contributions, employer match, expected rate of return, and other factors.
